This program is a hangman game
It uses a basic text file with words in it as a data base to create "shell" of the words by number of digits, the player is then allowed to guess either a letter or the whole word, a process which is verified by parts, can is capable of producing errors for guesses already made, words with too many characters, in addition to the traditional wrong answer. Further more there is a hangman animation in which for every wrong choice the player makes a part of the hangman, total 6, is added to the diagram. When the player guesses the word or looses by creating a full hangman they will be prompted to play again or quit the program. The database has a total of 26 words to be used in the game and more may be added if one wishes, however assure correct spelling so as to not break the game.
